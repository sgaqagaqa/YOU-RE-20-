        One thing I love about you is how you always want to talk to me.
        <br> No matter whether you're available or not you always respond to me and carry a conversation. 
        <br>Most couples nowadays leave each other on read all the time and we never do that to dali. We always respond fast ( if we not getting this bread ).
        <br> To me this shows that our love is a testament.
        <br> We will never get bored because we can talk about anything at any time ( endless honeymoon phase ). 
        <br> I really love when you ask me questions about anything, as you're so never hesitant and it makes me feel more wanted when you do.
        <br> With that being said keep being you, you're an Amazing Girlfriend and I never want you to change.
