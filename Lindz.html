    <h1> Dear Lord </h1> 
    <br>
<h2> Thank you for today. </h2> 
<br>
<h3> Thank you for my life and my beautiful girlfriend. She is honestly one of the greatest gifts that you have blessed me with. 
<br>
<br>
 I pray that she overflows with hopefulness and love today. I pray that she earnestly seeks intimate time with you, by reading your word, praying or generally spending time with you Lord. 
<br> 
<br>
My hope is that she reads a part of a scripture that speaks into her life. May she sense your presence and when doing so may you reveal to her, her precious truths about who she is and what her future holds.
 <br>
 <br>
 Holy Spirit teach Lindi your ways and use me as your son to lead her in those ways. I pray that my girl is also encouraged by the women around her, through their smiles, hugs, words of appreciation and recognition. 
<br> 
<br>
Please use the people amongst her genuine soul to show her just how much she is loved and cared for. Lord use me to lift her up in times of need and faint heartedness, to admire her on days when she feels she isn't admirable, to thank her for all she has done when feeling undeserving, to bless her by your fortunate grace and mercy and to lastly connect with the deep places in her heart, places she may be fearful of showing me. <br>
 I pray dearly and hope that our relationship is testimony of what's for you will stay with you (Prov 14:30). Lord I pray she's content with our relationship, by being hopeful for our maturity for as long as we are meant to be as a couple.
 <br>
 <br>
 I pray joy is witnessable on her face, through her golden brown eyes, and her smile that stops the world around her. Remind her that she is worthy and that you Lord love her so much. Overwhelm my partner's heart with peace by the power of the Holy Spirit. <br> I pray this in Jesus' Almighty name,
 <br>
 <br>
 AMEN ! </h3> </p> `; } </script>

    <h1> Where do I even begin with you Sthandwa sam: </h1> 
 <br>
<h3> First of all I think we've both established that us not talking to each other on a daily basis is suicide.
<br>
<br>
 Making you happy has been my first priority before anything else
 <br>
 even if I'm not happy or down, I always make sure that you're happy and okay because I care about you soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much more than you know. 
<br>
<br> 
I can't even put my love for you in words, to be honest, it's like every day I grow more fond and more in love with you than the previous day. 
<br>
 Just everything about you is so perfect, I can't stress this enough. There's just some form of comfortability that comes with your voice, 
<br> 
anytime you talk, and no matter what it is you're talking about, you just always find a way to give me the biggest smile and it's the best feeling ever, especially from that cute laugh of yours that you say is a poor person's laugh. 
<br>
 To those random things you do during the day that make me look and smile at my phone like I'm some kid getting candy.
 <br>
<br>
 You are so special to me baby, you're the only one I don't mind losing sleep for, the only one who I can never get tired of talking to, and the only one who crosses my mind constantly throughout the day. 
<br> 
You're the only one who can make me smile without trying, bringing down my bad mood without the intention to end affecting my emotions with every action of yours.
 <br>
 You're the one I'm afraid of losing and the one I truly want to keep in my life. 
<br>
<br>
 I just love you and everything that comes with you, man. I pray God keeps our relationship solid and that he may be merciful, generous, and graceful towards us. </h3>`; } </script>
