        <h3 style="background-color:rgba(238, 84, 238, 0.952);">
            I mean that I accept you for who you are, with all your insecurities and
             <br> 
            what you see as imperfection, I only see simply as parts of you that make you yourself whole and perfect. 
            <br> 
            This means that I won't try to change you into someone different, it means that I will always care for you and be there for you no matter what comes in between us. 
            <br>
             It means I'll also stand by you and love you through and through the worst of times. Yes that means loving you in your bad mood, when you're sad, when you overthink and when you're anxious. 
             <br>
             <p></p>
             Loving you and supporting you when you're too tired to do the things I want to do.
             <br>
              Its me putting you before my selfish desires and neccesities. It means loving you all of the time. 
              <br>
              My I love you means you can tell me anything if you ever want to and I'll always listen and never judge you. 
              <br>
              All I ask for in return is that you don't judge me for the things I may tell you. 
              <br> 
              I will still care enough to fight for you, hold you and never let go. I'm always thinking of you, dreaming of you, wishing I could be with you when I'm not. 
              <br>
              <p></p>
              I love you to me, is the connection between two people's hearts, beauty, personalities, and souls. This means that we are intertwined into each others paths. Thus I'm not only in "this" for a sexual pleasure, but I'm in this relationship for all of you, this may entail everything that you do and feel. 
              <br> 
              We both know that for the longest time that we've had a deeper connection, one thats deeper than anyone elses and I wouldn't be able to comprehend what this means to me.
              <br>
               There is more to My I love you than words can describe, (well other than the words i'm describing to you rn)
              <br> 
              <p></p>
              With that being said ngiyathemba kuthi ilanga lakho izahamba kahle, nokuthi konke kuzahamba kahle namuhla
